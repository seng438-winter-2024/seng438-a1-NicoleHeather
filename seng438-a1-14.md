# Introduction

Testing is a cricial aspect of software engineering, it helps to ensure the quality and efficiency of a product while also providing a pathway of communication between developer and client. The purpose of this lab is to explore the pracical procedures and introdcuce proper bug reporting in a team enviroment. This groups knowledge of exploratory and manual testing was purely theoretical before the execution of this lab, but after we now have a better understanding of how testing procedure takes place in a practical development enviroment.
