<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Testing is a critical aspect of software engineering; it helps to ensure the quality and efficiency of a product while also providing a pathway of communication between developer and client. The purpose of this lab is to explore the practical procedures and introduce proper bug reporting in a team environment. This group’s knowledge of exploratory and manual testing was purely theoretical before the execution of this lab, but, after, we now have a better understanding of how testing plans operate in real development environments. There are also differences in the procedure that we did not think of before, such as the more humanlike interaction in the system in exploratory testing, compared to the heavily standardized manual testing.</p>
<h1 id="high-level_description_of_the_exploratory_testing_plan">High-level_description_of_the_exploratory_testing_plan</h1>
<p>Test Strategy:
We wanted to focus our attention on the functionalities that are the most used and if the system could handle incorrect inputs, as these kinds of inputs are a majority of what the ATM must deal with. These inputs should mostly be sequential, unless a bug causes the system to become unresponsive. For this specific system there is also a lot for the program to keep track of, such as the total balance and amount available. It is important to test for those values being correct, while also recording them in the receipt and log.</p>
<p>Features To Be Tested:
Functionality 	            Actors/Users	Description
Account Withdraw	        Customer 	    Customer: Can withdraw from a chosen account
Account Transfer	        Customer 	    Customer: can transfer from one account to another
Account Deposit	            Customer 	    Customer: Can deposit from a chosen account
Account Inquiry	            Customer	    Customer: Can see the total balance and amount available for a certain account
Card/Pin Authentication	    Customer	    Customer: A customer can re-enter their pin or card number if incorrect
Transaction Canceling	    Customer	    Customer: can cancel transaction, then either continue or quit ATM
Receipt Retrieval 	        Customer	    Customer: can take a receipt that has all transactions up until that point</p>
<p>The functionalities not accounted for are:
o	User interface functionality
o	Hardware Interface
o	Database Logic
o	Communication interface
o	Security
o	Performance</p>
<p>Test Type: We are purely using exploratory testing for this lab.</p>
<p>Risk and Issues:
Risk	                                    Mitigation
The project schedule could be too strict	Ensure open communication to possibly reschedule or re-assign tasks
Lack of knowledge about Azure	Take the time to educate team on the functionalities and benefits of Azure</p>
<p>Who is testing?
The main four members of this lab group will complete this testing together. There are no cost or time constraints within this lab.</p>
<p>When will the tests occur?
This group took about 2 hours to plan and organize our exploratory testing before execution. After we took about 30 minutes to fully examine and record everything.</p>
<p>Test Objective:
The purpose of this examination is to ensure that the system is efficient, accurate, and provides all the functionalities specified in its requirements. But to also become familiar with test planning and execution at an industry level.</p>
<p>Test Criteria:
There is no specific suspension or exit criteria, only that we stop our testing after 30 minutes in accordance with the procedure of this lab. These testing processes are merely a way for us to be familiarized with standard industry practices.</p>
<p>Resource Planning:
System Requirements:
No.	Resources 	        Description</p>
<ol>
<li>Computer	        Needs to be able to download and run both applications. No other requirements</li>
<li>Azure	            Needs to be able to accurately maintain the information we provide about our bugs</li>
<li>Microsoft Excel	    Needs to be understandable and facilitate cooperation across team members</li>
</ol>
<p>Human Requirements:
No.	Resources 	        Description</p>
<ol>
<li>Test Manager	    Manages and directs the process of exploratory testing.</li>
<li>Test Executer	    Performs the actual test cases and records their progress, also reporting the bugs in Azure</li>
</ol>
<p>Test Environment:
The testing environment remains relatively simple for the purposes of this lab. For the exploratory section there are two pairs working on one computer each. They both run the application with the previously discussed plans.</p>
<p>Schedule and Estimation:
All Project Tasks and Execution:
Task	                Members	                        Estimate Effort
Perform Test Execution 	Test Manager, Test Executors 	4 man – 1/2 hour
Test Reporting 	        Test Manager, Test Executors 	4 man – 36 hours
Total		                                            4 man - 36 ½ hours</p>
<p>Schedule to Complete Tasks:
Task Name	            Start Date	            End Date
Perform Test Execution 	Thursday, Jan 25 2024	Sunday, Jan 28 2024
Milestone 	            Monday, Jan 29 2024	    Monday, Jan 29 2024

<h1 id="comparison-of-exploratory-and-manual-functional-testing">Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing</h1>
<p>Exploratory testing provided a more freeform and adaptable procedure to test the system. We were able to identify bugs from all different angles of this program, including errors with incorrect inputs and with normal input. Exploratory testing in execution was less time consuming, but slightly less efficient than the structured approach of manual testing. Manual testing provides a far deeper exploration of the functionalities focused on, keeping track of specific system states and their input.</p>
<h1 id="notes-and-discussion-of-the-peer-reviews-of-defect-reports">Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports</h1>
<p>Due to the way we tested these applications, many of the bugs reported were already discussed and recorded as a group. This helped make communication clear and understandable, but we did use Azure as the basis for regression testing. We also noticed that including detail in the steps was crucial. We often would go back to tests in both exploratory and manual to see if we could replicate the errors or successes to confirm the results of our testing.</p>
<h1 id="how-the-pair-testing-was-managed-and-team-workeffort-was-divided">How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided</h1>
<p>Pair tested was managed by splitting larger tasks into two. Exploratory was done simultaneously with each pair, it was also timed to ensure that an equal amount of time was given for each section. We also had each pair test different functionalities: common paths or edge cases. For manual, two people lead v1.0 and another pair lead v.1.1. Keeping the leaders for the versions different separate made sure that every student took part in the recording and leading process. Eventually after the completion of both testing plans, we came together as a group to discuss the results.</p>
<h1 id="difficulties-encountered-challenges-overcome-and-lessons-learned">Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned</h1>
<p>The most difficult parts of this lab were the execution of exploratory testing and learning the process of proper bug reporting. Exploratory testing and its lack of clear structure sometimes made it difficult to determine if the testing we did was enough to demonstrate an understanding of the actual procedure. We overcame this challenge by dividing some of the functionalities between each pair and allowing them to create a smaller testing procedure that would eventually combine with the other pair. The other challenge was only an issue due to the new technology used, none of us had ever used Azure before so there was a slight learning process in how it was supposed to function which did delay some work.</p>
<h1 id="commentsfeedback-on-the-lab-and-lab-document-itself">Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself</h1>
<p>We do think that the lab was a good learning experience and introduction to the professional testing and bug reporting procedure. Although a small walkthrough of Azure or Atlassian would have likely been useful, also would have made clear what our reports should have looked like in that form. The other comment would be the structure of the lab document itself. We think that the inclusion of questions to answer is very helpful in providing clear structure, but it is strange that the report cannot be done in Word or Google Docs, as these platforms provide tools to make formatting and writing clearer and easy to edit. However, these are not detrimental issues.</p>
